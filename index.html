        <p>** Active cases are locally acquired COVID-19 cases with onset in the last four weeks. This is based on the date the person first developed symptoms. When no date of symptom onset is available (it is either under investigation by public health staff or the person tested positive without showing symptoms), the date of the positive test is used. Infections are not always acquired in the place of residence as people often travel outside their area for many reasons (e.g. work, school and shopping).
            ***The heatmap excludes 189 cases in crew members who tested positive while on board a ship docked in NSW at the time of diagnosis.</p>
